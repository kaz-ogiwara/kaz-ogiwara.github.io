				<p>This timeline is a visualization of national elections, espacially focusing on elections due to dissolution, of lower houses in G7 countries.</p>
				<p>On 22 October, all members of Japanese lower house (House of Representatives) will be elected. This is the 25th election after WW II, of which 24 times are elections due to dissolution of the house.</p>
				<p>In Japan, the lower house has shorter term of service and stronger political power, compared with the House of Councilors, and could be dissolved by no-confidence proposal to the Cabinet or <a href="http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government/frame_01.html" target="_blank">"the advice and approval of the Cabinet"</a>. The latter type of dissolution, substantially the decision of the Prime Minister, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/world/asia/japan-abe-election.html" target="_blank">often criticized of cynical timing</a>.
				<p>So what happens if the timing of the elections were compared with other countries? Based on news articles and <a href="http://dl.ndl.go.jp/view/download/digidepo_10202206_po_0923.pdf?contentNo=1" target="_blank">Takazawa (2016), a paper that took a general view of systems of dissolution in G7 countries</a>, I plotted timings of national elections of lower houses of G7 countries (The U.S. does not have system of dissolution but is plotted the left side for your information).</p>
				<p>The larger number of dissolutions the country has experienced, the more right side it is placed. The colors are based on the reasons of the election: orange circles are elections due to dissolution decided by the head of the state such as the president or the prime minister, blue circles are dissolutions due to no-confidence proposal to the Cabinet, and gray small circles are elections due to expiration of term of office, including automatic dissolution after expiration. The number of dissolutions and the average period of term (not legal but practical) are shown under each national flag.</p>
				<p>The visualization shows that Japan has the largest number of dissolutions in G7, 24 times, and the second shortest practical term of service, following The US. While Canada and The UK follow Japan, the two countries changed their law in 2007 and 2011 respectively in order to restrict abusing dissolution. In the near future, Japan may follow the trend and the momentum of tightening the abusive dissolution may increase.</p>

				<p>- Reasons of dissolution are based on the paper above. "Due to non-confidence" includes approval of non-confidence resolution and rejection of confidence.</p>
				<p>- In some countries, I used data after constitution or form of government changed. Japan: after 1947, when the Constitution of Japan was enforced. Italy: after 1948, when Costituzione della Repubblica italiana was enforced. France: after 1958, when Fifth Republic was enforced.</p>
				<p>- The U.S. Congress does not have system of dissolution, and Representatives are reelected every 2 years.</p>
